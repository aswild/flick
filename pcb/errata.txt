Rev A

Summary:
  1) Swap pins 1/3 on both potentiometers
  2) Switch LED_TRIG to a diffused LED and increase its resistor significantly
  3) Use longer pads on U1, X1, and X2
  4) Move X1 (USB) as close to board edge as possible

1)
Both potentiometers (VR1, VR2) are wired backwards. CC/CCW is opposite of what
you'd expect. Bodge: lift pins 1 and 3 and use wires to cross-connect them.

2a)
The current limiting resistor for LED_TRIG (R3) is too small. 330ohm with a 2.6V
drop results in 2.1mA which is close enough to the datasheet's spec of 2mA, but
that's incredibly bright. Using software to PWM the LED at 10% (or even less)
looks much better. Bodge: replace R3 with a larger resistor. A 2.2k I had laying
around seems much better.

2b)
Using a clear LED for LED_TRIG was probably also not the best idea. Even with
the lower current it's still blinding when looking straight on. I should switch
to a diffused LED next time.

3)
It'll be worth the time making "hand soldering" versions of the 0.5mm pitch
connectors' footprints. USB and the FFC were really tricky because the leads are
so tiny, and longer pads would help. The TQFP wasn't so bad because of big leads
on the part itself, but longer pads would still be nice.
Also the corner mounting pads for the FFC connector were too small to properly
get solder in there.

4)
The USB connector should be moved closer to the board edge. From the footprint,
it seemed like the connector would overhang the board edge somewhat, but in reality
it's pretty much flush with the board edge (totally by chance). More overhang makes
enclosure design easier, so get those mounting holes as close to the edge as
fab drill rules will allow.
